Development of messaging devices requires to test its functionality with various test-vectors and alignment with customer-requirements. This presentation will present you two crates: 1.) the crate "test-case-derive" enabling parametrized test-cases and 2.) the crate "test-generator" enabling test-case generation over filesystem-entries such as directories and files. This presentation will also explain how dependencies to IDL-files and test-vector-files can be managed with cargo-tooling reliably.

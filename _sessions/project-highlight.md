    bio: Alan is a software developer with a background in electronics engineering, who lives in Namibia and spends his days coding JavaScript and composing choral pieces. He saved his first program onto a cassette tape and then proceeded to pop the tape into a stereo just to hear what it’d sound like. Turns out that’s a whole genre of music.

# The Pitch

We're hosting a remote-only conference for Embedded Rust Development on **Friday, March 20th at 17:00 CET/09:00 PDT**, running approximately 4 hours! We'll be hosting the event via [Zoom](https://zoom.us), and Speakers and Attendees are welcome from around the world, **no travel necessary**.

We're offering some of the highlights of OxidizeConf, in a convenient remote package! **Oxidize 1K** means 10 * 10 * 10:

* **10 lightning talks** - all showcasing projects in Embedded Rust!
* **10 minutes for each talk** - No time for deep dives!
* **10 EUR tickets** - So everyone can attend!

# Speakers and Schedule

Currently, we are still working with our speakers to decide on the specific timeline for the conference. The ordering and other small adjustments will be made closer to the event.

At the moment, we are waiting for our final speaker confirmations. If you are a speaker and do not see your talk here, please check your inbox for a confirmation email, or [send us a message](mailto:oxidize@ferrous-systems.com) ASAP!

Each talk is 10 minutes long, and will be followed by a short break (not shown in the schedule).

All times presented in CET (UTC+1) on Friday, March 20th.

# Questions and Answers

**Does this mean the main Oxidize Conference will be cancelled?** Nope! However due to the [Covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) situation, we need to get creative. Going virtual or delaying the conference if necessary may be an option for Oxidize, but no decisions have been made yet.

**What does the money go towards?** The ticket sales for Oxidize 1K go towards infrastructure costs, as well as the ability to potentially reimburse speakers for necessary equipment.

**Can my company sponsor Oxidize 1k?** - Sure! [Send us a message](mailto:oxidize@ferrous-systems.com), and we're happy to discuss.

**Can I talk about non-embedded subjects?** Your talk should be relevant to Rust and embedded, but that's all.

**What setup do I need to speak?** A video camera and a microphone. Headset or Laptop is fine. We may be able to reimburse for minimal speaker equipment, depending on sales.

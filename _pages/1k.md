# The questions

**Does that mean Oxidize is cancelled?** No, but we need to get creative. But as going virtual is an option, we want to learn.

**What does the money go to?** Online platform payments and the ability to potentially pay speakers equipment.

**Can I talk about non-embedded subjects?** Your talk should be relevant to embedded, but that's all.

**What setup do I need to speak?** A video camera and a microphone. Headset or Laptop is fine. We may be able to pay minimal speaker equipment, depending on sales.

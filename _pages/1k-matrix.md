# Getting Started

Besides the video feed on Zoom, we will have an ongoing chat community on our own matrix server.

The best way to get into our community is by clicking the following links for our official rooms:

* [**Welcome**](https://matrix.to/#/#ox1k-welcome:chat.berline.rs)
* More rooms coming soon! Check back before the event.

Here are some guidelines on how to use our community chat:

## Room description

Oxidize 1K will have 100s of attendees. Therefore, we must split the audience somehow and we believe that works best by _allowing you to choose your style_, while giving you a number of options.

## Group rooms

We think that ongoing discussions of more then 10 people are too much. For that reason, we will provide a number of pre-created group rooms. We recommend joining one of them in the beginning and start talking there.

The rooms are open, but is intended to be kept in roughly that size - this is to ensure that the chat can be followed and no 300 voices speak at the same time.

## Talk rooms

Every talk will have a special room assigned. The room will be named after the speaker and the talk topic. Questions on the talk can be asked there.

## Free rooms

Please feel free to create your own rooms on your own project!

## Project rooms

If you run an open source project, we want to encourage you to create your own room to chat with people there!

## The announcement room

This rooms is for organisers only to make annoucements about the conference. Join it, but read-only.

## The community announcement room

Use the announcement room only to announce things like "we created a channel discussing topic X". Please keep discussion low there.

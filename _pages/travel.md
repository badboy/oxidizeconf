## ChildCare

We provide child care for our conference attendees and no additional fees. We cater to any needs, but need to know a bit about your kid!

If you would like to bring your kid, please answer the relevant question in the ticket process and mail <a href="mailto:oxidizeconf@ferrous-systems.com?subject=Child%20care%20at%20Oxidize">contact us</a> before April 1st, 2019 so we can plan for child care. Requests after that time cannot be guaranteed, but still get in touch. <br /> Please include:

- Their age
- Their spoken languages
- Any special things we need to be aware of (e.g. allergies, illnesses, food preferences, but only to the extent the caregiver needs to know)

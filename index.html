				<table class="infotable">
					<tr>
						<th>Workshop</th>
						<th>Topic</th>
						<th>Trainers</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Beginner</td>
						<td>This workshop is an introduction to developing embedded systems using the Rust programming language. Participants will learn about the tools and libraries commonly used, how to interface with items on and off of the microcontroller, and will build their first driver for an external component.</td>
						<td>Led by <a href= "https://ferrous-systems.com/">Ferrous Systems</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Advanced</td>
						<td>This workshop is for developers already familiar with embedded systems in Rust, who are looking to extend their knowledge. Participants will interface with an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless radio, and exercises will focus on developing efficient, concurrent, and portable low level software.</td>
						<td>Led by <a href= "https://ferrous-systems.com/">Ferrous Systems</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Real Time for the Masses</td>
						<td>This workshop is focused on the <a href="https://github.com/japaric/cortex-m-rtfm#real-time-for-the-masses">Real Time for the Masses concurrency framework</a>, and will demonstrate the simplicity of developing embedded applications using the RTFM framework, from a small blinky to a fully fledged system. This workshop covers a wide range of topics, and is a great choice for developers between the Beginner and Advanced levels</td>
						<td>Led by <a href="https://github.com/korken89/">Emil Fresk</a>, PhD and <a href="https://github.com/perlindgren/">Per Lindgren</a>, PhD

				<h3>Conference Talks</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><strong>April 27th, 2018</strong></p>
				<p>The <strong>Oxidize Conference</strong> is the main event, showcasing the use of Rust in the Embedded Systems domain, with a focus on real world and production use-cases.</p>

				<p>We are inviting the Rust and Embedded communities to submit talks for our conference! Conference Talks will be selected through a Call for Proposals (CFP) process. Details and deadlines of the CFP process will be announced shortly. We welcome both hobbyists and professional developers to submit their proposals. Both beginner and experienced speakers are expressively welcome! OxidizeConf has 6-8 regular speaking slots, depending on the length of the individual talks.</p>

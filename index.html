				<h3>Workshops - April 26th, 2018</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>The <strong>OxidizeConf Workshops</strong> are a one day, two track set of workshops led by <a href= "https://ferrous-systems.com/">Ferrous Systems</a>. Tickets for the OxidizeConf Workshops are sold separately from Conference tickets.</p>

				<p>The tracks will be divided as "Beginner" and "Advanced" Embedded Rustlang development. Each track consists of a morning and afternoon session. The Beginner Track will be aimed at embedded developers new to Rust, and get them up and going in Embedded Rust development. The Advanced track will be focused on developers already familiar with Embedded and Rust, who are looking to get more comfortable developing drivers and applications.</p>

				<p>Participants will be provided all embedded hardware necessary for the course.</p>

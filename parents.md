Like in the sea the older ones should care for the little ones. With that in mind, we provide child care for our conference attendees. We cater to any needs, but need to know a bit about your kid!

If you would like to bring your kid, [contact us](mailto:oxidizeconf@ferrous-systems.com?subject=Child%20care%20at%20Oxidize) before April 1st, 2019 so we can plan for child care. Requests after that time cannot be guaranteed, but still get in touch. Please include:

* Their age
* Their spoken languages
* Any special things we need to be aware of (e.g. allergies, illnesses, food preferences, but only to the extent the caregiver needs to know)
